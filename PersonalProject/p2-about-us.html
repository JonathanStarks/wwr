        <p class="contact-par">This idea came to me after I was told that my cholesterol was too high and that I needed to start working out. I knew that I could do it as I had done sports in high school, but for some reason this time was different, I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. I felt insecure about myself, I didn’t want other people to look at me while I was exercising because I didn’t want to feel judged. It took a while, but eventually I was able to start working out, and it was rough, I thought that if I could have just been more comfortable in the gym, I would have been able to start easier. Just because something is difficult to start doesn’t mean that it isn’t worth the effort. The equipment that we offer ranges from treadmills that let the user walk through a virtual world on a set path, climbing machines that allow the user to get an adrenaline rush all while only being about one or two feet off the ground at all times, and benches that double as squat racks that prevent the user from being injured due to dropping a heavy weight on themselves. All these machines are able to be used together to solve puzzles so that while you exercise your body, you also are able to exercise your most important muscle, your brain.</p>
