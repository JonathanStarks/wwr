    <hr>
    <p>This idea came to me after I was told that My cholesterol was too high and that I needed to start working out. I knew that I could do it as I had done sports in high school, but for some reason this time was different, I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. I felt insecure about myself, I didn’t want other people to look at me while I was exercising because I didn’t want to feel judged. It took a while, but eventually I was able to start working out, and it was rough, I thought that if I could have just been more comfortable in the gym, I would have been able to start easier. Just because something is difficult to start doesn’t mean that it isn’t worth the effort. As far as I know, my idea is completely unique, I aim to provide a way for people who either struggle with starting to exercise or who live in an extreme environment and can’t go outside for a part of the year. By having a treadmill with a VR headset, the user will be able to immerse themselves in whatever world they want. This will help the user be more comfortable, more eager to work out, it will give them better exercise experience, and all this while in a safe environment.</p>
