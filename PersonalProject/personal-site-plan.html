This is not meant to be a permanent solution to exercise anxiety, it is meant to help people grow more comfortable with working out to hepl them to a point where they can be confident enough to exercise with others without fear. We rent out our machines for people to use until they are ready to work out with others.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        As far as we know, our idea is unique, we aim to provide a way for people who either struggle with starting to exercise or who live in an extreme environment and can’t go outside for a part of the year. By having a treadmill with a VR headset, the user will be able to immerse themselves in whatever world they want. This will help the user be more comfortable, more eager to work out, it will give them better exercise experience, and all this while in a safe environment.

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        This idea came to me after I was told that my cholesterol was too high and that I needed to start working out. I knew that I could do it as I had done sports in high school, but for some reason this time was different, I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. I felt insecure about myself, I didn’t want other people to look at me while I was exercising because I didn’t want to feel judged. It took a while, but eventually I was able to start working out, and it was rough, I thought that if I could have just been more comfortable in the gym, I would have been able to start easier. Just because something is difficult to start doesn’t mean that it isn’t worth the effort. The equipment that we offer ranges from treadmills that let the user walk through a virtual world on a set path, climbing machines that allow the user to get an adrenaline rush all while only being about one or two feet off the ground at all times, and benches that double as squat racks that prevent the user from being injured due to dropping a heavy weight on themselves. All these machines are able to be used together to solve puzzles so that while you exercise your body, you also are able to exercise your most important muscle, your brain.

        Though we only rent out to individuals, we are willing to make sales to larger companies like gyms or arcades. For either, we will need payment information, a billing address, an address to deliver to (if different from the billing address), a phone number and email address, and if the customer is renting our machines, they will need to sign an agreement that they will take full responsibility for preventable damage to the equipment. There are some requirements to use our exercise machines, they must be able to connect to the internet in order to receive updates, however, internet connection is not required to run the programs. Our machines must be installed properly in order to avoid bodily harm, as they are extremely heavy it is vital that they are securely bolted to the floor. It is important that the machines are used as intended, this means that the user will use the provided safety measures such as the E-stop magnet clip on the treadmill, the safety harness on the climbing machine, and keep the software of the lifting machine up to date so that it can recognize a dropped bar. Failure to follow the safety standards can result in bodily harm of the user, damage to the equipment, the user paying for the repairs of the machine, and even the death of the user. It is important to know your own limits, do not push yourself harder than you need to, the activities are selected by the user as well as the level of intensity; they shouldn’t exhaust you and then leave you stuck in bed with sore muscles. Exercise isn’t supposed to be torture, it is supposed to help you be active and healthy.
