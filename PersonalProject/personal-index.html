            <p class="body-text1">Our purpose is to provide a means for those who want to get in shape but have a fear of exercising infront of other people. We aim to provide a treadmill that has a VR headset attached to it to provide a more comfortable environment for our clientell to workout in. This is not meant to be a permanent solution to exercise anxiety, it is meant to help people grow more comfortable with working out to hepl them to a point where they can be confident enough to exercise with others without fear. We rent out our machines for people to use until they are ready to work out with others.</p>
