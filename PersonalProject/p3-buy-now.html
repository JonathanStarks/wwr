    <p class="buy-now-par">Though we only rent out to individuals, we are willing to make sales to larger companies like gyms or arcades. For either, we will need payment information, a billing address, an address to deliver to (if different from the billing address), a phone number and email address, and if the customer is renting our machines, they will need to sign an agreement that they will take full responsibility for preventable damage to the equipment. There are some requirements to use our exercise machines, they must be able to connect to the internet in order to receive updates, however, internet connection is not required to run the programs. Our machines must be installed properly in order to avoid bodily harm, as they are extremely heavy it is vital that they are securely bolted to the floor. It is important that the machines are used as intended, this means that the user will use the provided safety measures such as the E-stop magnet clip on the treadmill, the safety harness on the climbing machine, and keep the software of the lifting machine up to date so that it can recognize a dropped bar. Failure to follow the safety standards can result in bodily harm of the user, damage to the equipment, the user paying for the repairs of the machine, and even the death of the user. It is important to know your own limits, do not push yourself harder than you need to, the activities are selected by the user as well as the level of intensity; they shouldn’t exhaust you and then leave you stuck in bed with sore muscles. Exercise isn’t supposed to be torture, it is supposed to help you be active and healthy.</p>
