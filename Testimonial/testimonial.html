        <p class="tiny-text">I know that I am a son of God, I know that He loves all His children and that He is watching over us. I know that Heavenly Father sent His son, Jesus Christ, to come to Earth and pay the price for our sins so that we may return to the presence of our Heavenly father. I know that Jesus has called a Prophet today, Russel M Nelson, to act as His mouth in the directing of His church.</p>
